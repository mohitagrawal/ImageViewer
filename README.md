ImageViewer
===========
This is a basic Android app to show images as a gallery. Images are fetched from this link
http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos

Objectives of this project :
- How to read JSON objects
- Use ViewAnimator to view gallery of images so that we can use swipe gestures to view next and previous images.
